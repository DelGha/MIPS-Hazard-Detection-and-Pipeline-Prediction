  A MIPS processor with a pipeline architecture designed at the Structure of Computer Systems laboratory.
--
  Besides the basic MIPS design and implementation, additional units were added. One for the detections of hazards and one for the prediction of branches.

  Multiple test programs are also presented, both in code and in the provided documentation.

  Additional resources and references for reading are presented in the documentation.
